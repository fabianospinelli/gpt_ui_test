# Monitoring and Reporting

This folder contains one folder "site", and it contains also the past M&R releases (MR2022 included).

## URL

For example, with MR2022 under Geonetwork, it will compose in the following: http://<host>/geonetwork/catalog/views/inspireportal/monitoringreporting/site/mr2022.html

Note: the past releases were taken as-is from the Geoportal classic git repository (https://citnet.tech.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/INSPGPTRLD/repos/inspire-geoportal-viewer/browse)

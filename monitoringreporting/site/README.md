Based on Geonetwork way of handling UI (ie. library wro4j), it detects copies of Javascript in order to create a single optimized javascript.
Therefore, you cannot have two Javascript files, in different folders, with the same names.
Or you have a common function inside these files, Geonetwork will not be able to start.

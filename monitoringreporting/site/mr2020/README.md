In `resources` there are a series of folders used by the dashboard. This `resources` path should be reachable and served by the HTTP server. Since it could take a lot of disk space, it has been moved in a dedicated folder on a different disk partition (ie. `/solr/inspire/xmlroot/mr2020/resources`)

- `/resources/geoportal`: it should contain all the JSON data retrieved from the geoportal. File name convention: INSPIRE-xxx.json
- `/resources/validator`: it should contain all the JSON data generated by the validator Spoon script. File name convention: INSPIRE-xxx.json
- `/resources/failed`: it should contain all the failed csv data file. File name convention: INSPIRE-xxx.csv
- `/resources/failed_report`: it should contain the archived test reports for each failed dataset or services, if available, generated by the validator Spoon script.
  - File name convention for dataset: INSPIRE-xxx.dataset.zip
  - File name convention for services: INSPIRE-xxx.services.zip
